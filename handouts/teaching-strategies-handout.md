# Teaching Strategies: Integrating AI Thoughtfully
*Practical approaches for incorporating AI into your teaching practice*

---

## Start Where You Are

### Week 1: Personal Exploration
**Before asking students to use AI, try it yourself:**
- Generate quiz questions for your next topic
- Create discussion prompts for tutorials
- Draft assignment rubrics
- Summarise key readings

**Document:** What worked? What needed fixing? How long did it take?

### Week 2: Transparent Modeling
**Show students your process:**
- "I used AI to generate these practice problems, then I..."
- "Here's the original AI output and here's why I changed it"
- "This rubric started with AI, but needed human expertise for..."

**Key:** Demonstrate critical evaluation, not blind acceptance

## Redesigning Assessments for an AI World

### From "What" to "How and Why"

**Traditional Assessment:**
"Write a 2000-word essay on marketing strategy"

**AI-Aware Assessment Options:**

**Option A: Process Documentation**
- Submit AI conversation transcript
- Annotate where AI was wrong/limited
- Reflection on how human expertise improved output
- Final submission shows evolution of thinking

**Option B: In-Class Components**
- AI-generated draft submitted before class
- In-class critique and improvement
- Peer review of AI use strategies
- Live presentation of key insights

**Option C: Personal Application**
- Connect theory to personal experience
- Include specific local context
- Require primary data collection
- Emphasise unique perspective

## Practical Classroom Activities

### 1. AI Error Hunt (15 minutes)
**Setup:** Generate course content with deliberate errors
**Activity:** Students identify and correct mistakes
**Learning:** Critical evaluation, subject mastery
**Debrief:** Why did AI make these errors?

### 2. Prompt Engineering Challenge (20 minutes)
**Setup:** Same question, groups craft different prompts
**Activity:** Compare AI outputs from various prompts
**Learning:** Importance of clear communication
**Debrief:** What made prompts more/less effective?

### 3. Human vs AI Debate (30 minutes)
**Setup:** AI generates one side of argument
**Activity:** Students argue opposite position
**Learning:** Critical thinking, argument construction
**Debrief:** What did AI miss about context/nuance?

### 4. AI Improvement Workshop (25 minutes)
**Setup:** AI creates initial solution/answer
**Activity:** Groups enhance with human insight
**Learning:** Value of domain expertise
**Debrief:** What uniquely human elements were added?

## Setting Clear Expectations

### Sample Syllabus Statement

> **AI Use in This Course**
> 
> Artificial Intelligence tools are part of professional practice in [field]. In this course:
> 
> - You MAY use AI for brainstorming, drafting, and exploration
> - You MUST disclose all AI use in assignments
> - You MUST verify all AI-generated content
> - You CANNOT submit unedited AI content as your own work
> 
> Think of AI as a research assistantâ€”helpful but requiring supervision. Your learning comes from evaluating and improving AI output, not from the output itself.

### Disclosure Examples

**Simple:** "AI assisted with initial research"

**Detailed:** "Used ChatGPT to generate outline structure, refined with course concepts, verified statistics through library databases"

**Comprehensive:** Appendix with prompts, outputs, and modification log

## Managing Different Scenarios

### When Students Over-Rely on AI
**Signs:** Generic responses, missing personal voice, can't explain work

**Strategies:**
- Require hand-written components
- Add oral examinations
- Include reflection on process
- Focus on application to specific contexts

### When Students Fear Using AI
**Signs:** Anxious about "cheating", falling behind peers

**Strategies:**
- Model your own AI use
- Start with low-stakes activities
- Provide clear guidelines
- Share success examples

### When AI Gives Wrong Information
**Opportunity:** Teaching moment about verification

**Strategies:**
- Celebrate error detection
- Discuss why AI made mistake
- Practice fact-checking methods
- Emphasise expertise value

---

## Progressive Integration Model

### Foundation Level (Weeks 1-4)
- Instructor demonstrates AI use
- Students observe and discuss
- Focus: Understanding capabilities/limitations

### Guided Practice (Weeks 5-8)
- Structured AI activities in class
- Clear parameters for use
- Focus: Developing critical evaluation

### Independent Application (Weeks 9-12)
- Students choose when/how to use AI
- Justify their decisions
- Focus: Strategic tool selection

### Synthesis (Final Weeks)
- Reflect on AI's role in learning
- Evaluate impact on understanding
- Focus: Meta-cognitive awareness

---

## Quick Implementation Ideas

### Monday: Lecture Prep
Use AI to generate example scenarios, verify for accuracy, share process with students

### Tuesday: Tutorial Planning
Create discussion questions with AI, add context-specific elements

### Wednesday: Assignment Design
Draft rubric with AI, modify for course objectives

### Thursday: Student Support
Use AI to create study guides, add personal expertise

### Friday: Reflection
Document what worked, adjust for next week

## Addressing Common Concerns

**"Students will cheat"**
â†’ Design assessments that require personal insight, process documentation, or live demonstration

**"AI undermines learning"**
â†’ Focus on higher-order thinking: evaluation, synthesis, creation

**"I don't understand AI"**
â†’ Start small, learn alongside students, share your journey

**"It's not fair if some students use AI"**
â†’ Make AI use transparent and optional, provide alternatives

---

## Assessment Rubric Adaptation

### Traditional Criteria â†’ AI-Era Criteria

**Knowledge Display** â†’ **Knowledge Application**
- Can recite facts â†’ Can verify AI facts
- Memorised content â†’ Contextualised understanding

**Writing Quality** â†’ **Thinking Quality**
- Grammar/spelling â†’ Argument construction
- Word count â†’ Idea development

**Research Skills** â†’ **Evaluation Skills**
- Found sources â†’ Assessed AI sources
- Citation accuracy â†’ Information verification

**Originality** â†’ **Synthesis**
- Unique phrasing â†’ Unique connections
- No plagiarism â†’ Acknowledged AI use

---

## Red Flags vs Green Flags

### ðŸš© Red Flags (Need Intervention)
- Cannot explain their work
- Inconsistent voice/knowledge level
- Missing assignment-specific requirements
- No personal connection to content

### ðŸŸ¢ Green Flags (Good Practice)
- Clear about AI's role
- Shows iteration and improvement
- Demonstrates critical thinking
- Adds personal/local context

---

## Resources for Further Development

### Essential Reading
- Your institution's AI policy
- Discipline-specific AI guidelines
- Student feedback on AI use

### Try This Week
1. Generate one lecture example with AI
2. Share the process with students
3. Ask students about their AI use
4. Document one success or failure

### Build Community
- Share experiences with colleagues
- Create discipline-specific prompt library
- Develop shared assessment strategies

---

## Final Reminders

âœ“ **You don't need to be an AI expert** â€” You need to be a learning expert

âœ“ **Perfect is the enemy of good** â€” Small experiments are valuable

âœ“ **Students are already using AI** â€” Better to guide than ignore

âœ“ **Your expertise matters more, not less** â€” AI makes human judgment crucial

âœ“ **Focus on learning outcomes** â€” Tools change, objectives remain
