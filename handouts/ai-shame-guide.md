# Moving Past AI Shame: A Discussion Guide
*Practical resources for navigating AI use in academic settings*

## Understanding AI Shame - Two Perspectives

### Academic Perspective: "AI Shaming in Academia"
*Summary of Louis Jere's article on AI stigma in higher education*

**Definition:** AI shaming is the stigma or criticism directed at academics who use AI tools, seen as undermining the ideal that scholarship should be entirely "human intellect-driven."

**Real Examples from Academia:**
- Researchers rejected from journals after editors discovered AI use for brainstorming
- Junior academics accused of cheating for using AI to polish writing
- Faculty hiding their AI use from tenure committees

**Types of AI Shamers Identified:**
- **Traditionalists** – Value established methods, resist change
- **Technophobes** – Fear technology and AI generally
- **Elitists** – See AI as threat to status or expertise
- **Luddites** – Fear disruption to academic livelihoods
- **Misunderstanders** – Don't grasp AI capabilities, default to sci-fi fears

**Consequences of AI Shaming:**
- Stifles innovation in research methods
- Wastes effort on repetitive tasks
- Creates underground usage without best practices
- Disadvantages early-career researchers

**The Bold Transparency Approach:**
Louis Jere openly used ChatGPT while writing about AI shaming, advocating for normalising disclosure as a path forward.

### Workplace Perspective: Fortune/Canva Study (2025)
*How AI shame manifests in professional settings*

**Key Findings:**
- 70% of knowledge workers use AI weekly
- 63% fear being seen as incompetent or lazy
- Most hide their AI use from colleagues
- Creates "readiness gap" between expectation and support

**The Pattern Across Sectors:**
Both academia and industry show similar patterns of shame, secrecy, and missed opportunities for collaborative learning.

## Reframing Our Relationship with AI

### From Shame to Partnership

**Traditional View:** "Real scholarship is purely human intellect"
**Alternative View:** "Scholarship is human intellect directing appropriate tools"

**Traditional View:** "Using AI is cheating"
**Alternative View:** "Using AI without disclosure or understanding is problematic"

**Traditional View:** "AI threatens academic integrity"
**Alternative View:** "Hidden AI use threatens integrity; transparent use enhances it"

**Traditional View:** "AI will replace academics"
**Alternative View:** "AI augments academic capabilities for those who master it"

### Questions for Reflection
Rather than prescribing how to think, consider:
- What tools do you already use that were once controversial? (calculators, spell-check, citation managers)
- How is AI different from or similar to these tools?
- What would responsible, transparent AI use look like in your discipline?
- How might AI free you to focus on higher-level academic work?

## Moving Forward: A Collaboration Mindset

### Proposed Actions (from the literature)

**Individual Level:**
- Experiment with one small task
- Document and share your process
- Practice transparent disclosure
- Shift from "human vs. machine" to "human + machine"

**Department Level:**
- Create safe spaces for AI experimentation
- Share both successes and failures
- Develop discipline-specific guidelines
- Educate about actual AI capabilities (vs. sci-fi myths)

**Institutional Level:**
- Establish clear, supportive policies
- Provide training and resources
- Recognise AI literacy as professional development
- Support "post-digital academic writing" practices

### Key Message from Research

Both academic and industry research conclude: AI should be seen as an **augmenting partner**, not a replacement. Overcoming shame requires honesty about use, curiosity about possibilities, and willingness to evolve practices.
