# Student Communication Templates: AI in the Classroom
*Ready-to-use language for clear communication with students about AI use*

---

## First Day of Class: Setting Expectations

### Verbal Introduction (3 minutes)
>"Let's talk about AI and this course. I know many of you are already using ChatGPT or similar tools - and that's okay. In fact, I use them too. In this class, we'll learn how to use AI effectively and ethically in [discipline]. 
>
>Think of AI like a calculator in maths - it's a tool that can help, but you still need to understand the concepts. You wouldn't submit a calculator's display as your homework; similarly, you won't submit raw AI output as your work.
>
>What matters is transparency. Tell me when and how you use AI. There's no shame in using tools well - there's only a problem when you hide it or don't understand what you're submitting."

### Follow-Up Discussion Prompts
- "How many of you have tried ChatGPT or similar tools?"
- "What worked well? What surprised you?"
- "What concerns do you have about using AI in your studies?"

>• You CANNOT replace your own critical thinking with AI output
>
>View AI as a research assistant or tutor - helpful for learning, but not a substitute for your own understanding.

### Option B: Structured Approach
>**AI Use Guidelines**
>
>Permitted AI uses:
>- Brainstorming and idea generation
>- Grammar and style checking
>- Finding information (with verification)
>- Creating study materials

>- Whether AI use is allowed
>- How to document AI assistance
>- What level of AI engagement is appropriate
>
>Let's learn together how to use these tools professionally and ethically.

>If you use AI tools for this assignment, include a brief statement describing:
>1. Which AI tools you used (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly)
>2. How you used them (e.g., brainstorming, proofreading)
>3. What changes you made to the AI output
>
>Example: "I used ChatGPT to generate initial topic ideas and outline structure. I then researched all points independently, wrote the content myself, and used Grammarly for final proofreading."

### For Assignments Requiring AI Use

## Marking Feedback Templates

### When AI Use is Well-Documented
>"Good transparency in documenting your AI use. I can see how you've used ChatGPT for initial research and then built upon it with your own analysis. Your improvements to the AI's generic response show understanding of the topic. Next time, consider also..."

### When AI Use Needs Better Integration
>"While you've acknowledged using AI, the assignment still reads like raw AI output in places. See paragraphs 2 and 4 - these need more of your own voice and specific examples from our course. Remember, AI should support your thinking, not replace it."

### When Suspected AI Use is Not Disclosed
>"Please see me to discuss this assignment. Some sections appear inconsistent with your usual writing style and in-class contributions. If you used AI or other assistance, it's important to acknowledge this. Let's talk about effective and appropriate use of support tools."

---

## In-Class Discussion Scripts

### Introducing an AI-Integrated Activity
>"Today we're going to use AI as a learning tool. Everyone open ChatGPT or your preferred AI. We'll generate [content] together, then critically evaluate what it produces. This isn't about getting perfect answers - it's about understanding AI's capabilities and limitations in our field."

### When Students Express Confusion About AI Policies
>"I understand the confusion - AI policies are evolving everywhere. In this class, the simple rule is: be transparent. If you used it, say so. If you're unsure whether you can use it, ask me. There's no penalty for appropriate, acknowledged use. The only problem is hiding it."

### Addressing AI Anxiety
>"Some of you might be worried that AI will replace you in your careers. Let's reframe this: AI is a tool that will make you more effective. Your critical thinking, creativity, and human judgment become MORE valuable, not less. We're learning to work WITH AI, not compete against it."

## FAQ Response Templates

### "Is using AI cheating?"
>"Using AI isn't automatically cheating - hiding it is. Think of it like using any other tool or resource. If you use a textbook, you cite it. If you use AI, you acknowledge it. Cheating happens when you claim AI's work as entirely your own or use it when specifically told not to."

### "How much AI use is too much?"
>"If you can't explain your work without AI, you've used too much. AI should help you learn and express ideas, not learn for you. A good test: Could you discuss this topic intelligently in class without AI? If not, you need to engage more deeply with the material."

### "Will AI make my degree worthless?"
>"Your degree represents your ability to think critically, solve problems, and apply knowledge - things AI cannot do independently. We're teaching you to use AI as a tool, just as accountants learned to use spreadsheets. The professionals who'll struggle are those who ignore AI, not those who master working with it."
