# Quick Reference: AI Tools for Education

*A practical companion to "AI in the Curriculum: Challenges & Opportunities"*

---

## Common AI Tools in Higher Education

### General Purpose AI Assistants

**What they are:** Conversational AI that can answer questions, generate content, and assist with various tasks.

**Examples:**

* **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) ‚Äì General purpose, widely used
* **Claude** (Anthropic) ‚Äì Strong analytical capabilities
* **Copilot** (Microsoft) ‚Äì Integrated with Office suite
* **Gemini** (Google) ‚Äì Connected to Google services

**Educational Uses:**

* Draft assignment questions
* Generate discussion prompts
* Create practice problems
* Develop rubrics
* Summarise readings

---

## Discipline-Specific Applications

### Marketing & Management

* Market analysis: Competitive intelligence, trend identification
* Case generation: Business scenarios with realistic constraints
* Data interpretation: Quick analysis of market research
* Strategy simulation: Scenario planning and risk assessment

### Accounting & Finance

* Problem sets: Generate practice calculations with solutions
* Excel formulas: Debug and optimise spreadsheets
* Report templates: Financial statement structures
* Concept explanations: Break down complex regulations

### Human Resources

## Strengths and Limitations

### Where AI Excels

‚úÖ Drafting and brainstorming new ideas
‚úÖ Summarising and simplifying long texts
‚úÖ Generating variations of content
‚úÖ Handling routine formatting and structures

### Where AI Falls Short

‚ö†Ô∏è Does not verify its own accuracy
‚ö†Ô∏è May produce plausible but incorrect outputs
‚ö†Ô∏è Struggles with specialised terminology
‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot fully understand context or nuance
‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent across sessions

### Avoid Using AI For

üö´ Personal or confidential information
üö´ Medical or legal advice
üö´ Final grading or assessment decisions
üö´ Replacing human connection in teaching

## Quick Decision Framework

| **Use AI When** | **Add Human Oversight When** | **Avoid AI When** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Brainstorming ideas | Accuracy is critical | Handling personal data |
| Drafting initial resources | Current/local info required | Providing legal/medical advice |
| Summarising readings | Discipline expertise required | Making final grading decisions |
| Creating variations | Student assessment involved | Replacing human connection |

## Practical Integration Tips

### Start Small

1. Pick one routine task
2. Test with AI assistance
3. Verify results thoroughly
4. Share what you learned

### Build Gradually

* **Week 1:** Personal productivity
* **Week 2:** Course preparation
* **Week 3:** Student resources
* **Week 4:** Assessment design

### Document Everything

* What worked (and what didn‚Äôt)
* Time saved or lost
* Student response

---

## Academic Integrity Considerations

### For Students

* Disclose AI use clearly
* Reflect on AI‚Äôs role in your work
* Show improvement or iteration
* Expect assessment to test *understanding*, not just production

### For Educators

* Model transparency in your own use
* Verify AI outputs before sharing
* Keep records of prompts and responses
* Share your process with students

---

## Getting Started Checklist

Before introducing AI in your course:

* [ ] Check institutional policies
* [ ] Understand the tool‚Äôs limitations
* [ ] Test with non-critical tasks first
* [ ] Plan for verification and oversight
* [ ] Decide how disclosure will work
* [ ] Consider equity and access issues
* [ ] Document your process

## First 5 Prompts to Try

1. "Generate three discussion questions for a second-year course on digital marketing."
2. "Summarise this 10-page reading into 5 key points for a tutorial."
3. "Create two variations of this assignment rubric with different weightings."
4. "Draft a short case study on supply chain ethics with discussion prompts."
5. "Write a sample feedback paragraph for a student essay that needs more evidence."

---

## Final Thought

**AI is a tool, partner, collaborator, not a solution.**
Its value depends on:

* How you use it
* When you use it
* Why you use it
* Your expertise in evaluating outputs

**Goal:** Augment your capabilities, not replace your judgment.
